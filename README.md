This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
3. Run the development server using `npm run run:server` or `yarn run:server` or `pnpm run:server` [This will start a local server on port 3001 served by json-server package giving us the mock data]
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev` [This will start the Next.js development server on port 3000]

## Some points to note

1. Used Taliwind CSS for styling
2. Used V0.dev to generate the mockups for the UI
3. Used Json-server to mock the API calls
4. Used shadcn/ui to create the UI components as fast as possible
5. Majorly focused on the desktop version of the UI and the functionality.
